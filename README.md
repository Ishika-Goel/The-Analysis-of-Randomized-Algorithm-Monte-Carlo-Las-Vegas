# The-Analysis-of-Randomized-Algorithm-Monte-Carlo-Las-Vegas

# INTRODUCTION
Randomized algorithms make random decisions rather than deterministic decisions. The main advantage is that no input can reliably produce worst-case results because the algorithm runs differently each time.
These algorithms are commonly used in situations where no exact and fast algorithm is known.
Our project focuses on the study of randomized algorithm mainly Monte Carlo and Las Vegas.
And also to study the comparative analysis between Monte Carlo and Las Vegas.
